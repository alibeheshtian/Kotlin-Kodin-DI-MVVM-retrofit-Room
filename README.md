# Android Clean Architecture 

## New version available written in Kotlin:

 1- language: Kotlin
 
 2- dependency injection: Kodien
 
 3- architect: MVVM
 
 4- network cominioretrofit-Room


Introduction
-----------------
This is a sample app that is part of a blog post I have written about how to architect android application using the Uncle Bob's clean architecture approach. 

Here are some useful Gradle/adb commands for executing this example:

 * `./gradlew clean build` - Build the entire example and execute unit and integration tests plus lint check.
 * `./gradlew installDebug` - Install the debug apk on the current connected device.
 * `./gradlew runUnitTests` - Execute domain and data layer tests (both unit and integration).
 * `./gradlew runAcceptanceTests` - Execute espresso and instrumentation acceptance tests.
